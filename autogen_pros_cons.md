| **Pros**                                    | **Cons**                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Easy to use & quick to start** – Requires minimal code to get started | ❌ **Limited design flexibility** – Interaction modes are fixed, making customization difficult |
| ✅ **Asynchronous & scalable** – Uses an actor-based model, supports distributed & async message passing | ❌ **Limited model integration** – Primarily supports OpenAI; other LLMs require additional configuration |
| ✅ **Strong integration with Microsoft's ecosystem** – Compatible with Azure, Databricks, etc. | ❌ **Lacks backtracking capability** – Cannot revisit or modify past execution steps |
| ✅ **Low-code development support** – AutoGen Studio provides a visual interface | ❌ **Limited manual intervention options** – Only supports three modes (never, always, interrupt) |
| ✅ **Supports streaming** – Enables real-time input/output processing | ❌ **Scalability still improving** – Despite being async, version 0.4 has room for optimization |
| ✅ **Built-in monitoring** – Works with AgentOps for debugging and tracking | ❌ **Documentation needs improvement** – Resources are scattered, making it hard to find information |
| ✅ **Partial manual intervention support** – Allows human input at specific points | ❌ **Heavy reliance on Microsoft** – Weak support for AWS and other cloud platforms |
